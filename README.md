# Mini AlexNet
This is a miniature version of AlexNet(Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton) developed to be trained on 32x32 RBG images.

Kindly note that this model has not been built for production, rather for experimentation and implementation. It is yet to be optimized for various issues such as overfitting and efficiency.
